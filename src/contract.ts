 * carries its own `surfaceOp` marker), so membership in `session.surface.nodes`
 * is exactly "the model sees this on the next request" — an O(1) read with no
 * cloning, no replay validation, and no cross-read race retry.
 *
 * Two mechanisms separate *loaded once* from *visible now*:
 *
 *   tool-result pruning   an over-long result is replaced by a head+marker+tail
 *                         stub ON the surface — the model sees the skill
 *                         partially (`pruned`)
 *   compaction            a span of surface nodes is replaced by one summary —
 *                         the skill's content is gone from the model's view
 *                         while its load record stays in the log (`evicted`)
 *
 * The original events always remain in the durable log; these states describe
 * the model's CURRENT view, not the archive.
